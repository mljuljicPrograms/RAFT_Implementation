This is a basic RAFT Protocal in which a user places a piece of a race track on a RaceTrack builder G.U.I and that is sent to a database that is sharded among three seprate machines. Once the leader recives the message it logs it into the database and then pings the followers to update there database. If the leader so happens to fail, then the followers will determine a new leader and the database continues.
